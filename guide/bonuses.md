Next, in the "Edit Channel", you can specify bonuses to experience / currency / reputation and luck as a percentage, as well as delete the bonus channel.

### What types of activities are bonuses given for:

1. Sending messages in the channel (Currency, experience, reputation, luck)
2. Voice channel communication (Currency, Experience, Reputation, Luck)
3. Using the command /fishing in the channel, fishing (only experience and luck)
