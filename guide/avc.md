In the menu, select the desired one, select the category in which our voice channels will be, select the channel that you will need to go to to create an author's channel and the name of the channel.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Create a separate category for your auto-voice channels, because the bot deletes channels if there are no members in them except for the channel-creator.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You can use [variables ](../variables/avc.md)for the channel name:

> **{creator}** - channel user name
>
> **#** - channel number in the format 1 2
>
> **{emoji}** - random emoji
{% endhint %}
