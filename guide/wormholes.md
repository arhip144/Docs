# ðŸŒ€ Wormholes

## What are wormholes?

These are events that appear in a certain channel at a certain moment

## What are wormholes for?

This is one of the many ways to get items, currency, experience, reputation

## How wormholes are works?

As soon as the wormhole appears, you have a chance to take all the items from it. By chance, it means that after a while it may disappear or another user may take it.

## Creating a Wormhole

To create a wormhole, run the command [/manager-wormholes create \<name>](../commands/admins.md)

In this panel, we configure:

* Style (not required) - a [guide to creating a style](styles.md)
* Item - the item that will drop out (Item/currency/experience/Reputation)
* Chance - chance of spawn from 1% to 100%
* Webhook - a webhook that will send a message
* Amount - the minimum and maximum amount of dropped item/currency/experience/reputation
* Lifetime - the lifetime of the wormhole in the channel
* Cron-pattern - [examples of patterns and an explanation of what they are](cron-patterns.md)
* The number of spawns - after the expiration, the wormhole will turn off

After all the settings, you need to turn on the wormhole

{% hint style="info" %}
To see what a wormhole will look like, you can execute the command [/wormhole-spawn \<name>](../commands/admins.md)
